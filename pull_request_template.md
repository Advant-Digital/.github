## TODOs left before this PR can be reviewed
- [ ] I have followed our [development process](https://github.com/Advant-Digital/internal-documentation/wiki/Utvecklingsrutin)
- [ ] Based the PR on relevant and updated branch (most often develop or master) and used a standardized branch name (e.g. `feature/article-listing-page` or `ticket/558-snowboard-school-rename`
- [ ] Made sure that no excess code are still left in the code (empty rows, `console.log`, `debugger`, debugger code, unused `use`)
- [ ] Though about if this PR affects something else than this isolated change
